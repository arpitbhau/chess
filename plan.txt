positions calculation:

- set default postions in list of dictionaries
- when a piece is moved, craft a string 
    - "W/B p/r/Kn/b/k/q d2 d4 x/m"
        -- W/B => white or black moved
        -- pieces:
            1. p - pawn
            2. r - rook
            3. Kn - knight
            4. b - bishop
            5. k - king
            6. q - queen
        -- source
        -- destination
        -- takes (x) or moves (m)

fns:

    - check move legality { !imp }
        -- update the memory accordingly
    
    - see checks

    - see checkmate

notation:
    - x-axis => rank
    - y-axis => file

working:

    - at start, the positions will be set to default.
        -- the memory of postions and peices alive will be kept in a array of object


    - for calculations we will be making a 2d world, comparing to graph plotting and crafting eqns for seeing attack ranges.

        -- we will plot points (pieces) on the graph considering it as a chess board

        -- for a perfect digonal and vertices we will run for loop for every point upto 8 and if the x and y coords are not a irrational number then the diagonal for seeking is right
